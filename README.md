# New Project

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.mjs` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.

### What I learned

I am currently upgrading my stack to use typescript. This is what I learned:

- How to use typescript in a simple project.
- How to use optional chaining.
- Using type casting.
- Using types to provide a blueprint for my objects.
- Typescript's type inference and setting explicit types.
- bundling my project using snowpack.

I also switched snowpack's tsconfig file to use my own custom config file by using the command tsc --init.
